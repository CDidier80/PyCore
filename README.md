#### Date: 10/17/2020


### Description
#### *A cloud-based Python 3 IDE.*


### Technologies utilized:
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JDoodle API


### Project Status:

Phase 1 of 2 is complete. The current version is deployed on surge with basic editing/code execution capability. Phase 2 completion scheduled in January 2021.

### Current API Integration:

The current API-integration is handled by routing through my Express proxy server. Code execution in the long-term may be migrated to Sphere Engine or may discontinue API integration altogether by deploying a Python code sandbox. 

### How to get started: 
Visit www.pycore.net and click "Begin" to navigate to the editor/console. The site currently supports basic, unguided code editing and compilation. 
Look for further feature releases in 2021.
